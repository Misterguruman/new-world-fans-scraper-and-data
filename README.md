# New World Fans image dump

## Note: 
This is our fansite API and it's not directly connected to anything related to the game or Amazon's systems. There is currently no official API.


A collection of images and corresponding scraper used. For creating new world related applications. 

All files are already downloaded so that there wont be a ton of people just bombing their servers with downloads.

## Disclaimer:

Please don't run the scraper unless you need to redownload something. We don't want to run the bill up over on their website hosting company.
